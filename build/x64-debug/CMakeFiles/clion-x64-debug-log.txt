The package glew is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    find_package(GLEW REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE GLEW::GLEW)

glfw3 provides CMake targets:

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(glfw3 CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE glfw)

glfw3 provides pkg-config modules:

  # A multi-platform library for OpenGL, window and input
  glfw3

glm provides CMake targets:

  # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
  find_package(glm CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE glm::glm)

stb is header-only and can be used from CMake via:

  find_path(STB_INCLUDE_DIRS "stb_c_lexer.h")
  target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${STB_INCLUDE_DIRS})
